Description:
The Online Auction System is a comprehensive web platform designed to facilitate online auctions where users can buy and sell items in a secure and streamlined manner. The system supports all stages of the auction process, including item listing, bidding, auction management, payment processing, and user feedback. Users can create an account, list items for auction, place bids, receive notifications, and rate other users after transactions.

Key features include user registration and authentication, real-time bidding, auction management tools, and integrated payment gateways to ensure secure transactions. The system also incorporates advanced search and browsing capabilities, enabling users to easily find auction items based on various filters and categories. Additionally, users receive notifications and alerts regarding auction status updates, bid statuses, and successful transactions.

The application also offers user feedback and ratings, ensuring a transparent and reliable platform where sellers and buyers can build trust through past transaction histories.
